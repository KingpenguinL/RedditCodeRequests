**What mods are involved:**
A list of the mods directly interacted with in the script. (Ex. CC:Bridge and Create, Farmer's Delight, etc.). This helps me when gathering item IDs, getting methods I can interact with, and testing purposes.

**Describe what you want the script to do:**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen, although specifics help. Screenshots and diagrams are also welcome.

* Note: Please remember, I'm doing this for fun and when I get free time. You can ask for updates, but please don't  rush me. Thank you :)
